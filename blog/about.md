Hi there. So you want to learn a little about me? Well, I spent 5 years in the Chicago ad industry before shipping off to Portugal to become a programmer. Fast forward to now, and this blog is my attempt to chronicle these Portuguese adventures in travel and code. It is also a test lab for my design experiments, so don't be surprised if the site changes before your eyes. Thanks for visiting, and head over to my portfolio site for more info on my background: [paulbusby.com](https://paulbusby.herokuapp.com)
