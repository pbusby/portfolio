"Hello, world." This famous phrase has been used by computer scientists the world over to write small test programs since the early 70's. It only seemed fitting that I kick off this new chapter in my life by repeating their mantra.

In October of last year (2018), I went back to school to learn how to code. I'm happy to report that the past 6 months have been an exhilarating blur of learning and building and breaking and fixing. Not only that, but I finally feel like I have a new lease on life.

I attended school in Portugal of all places, but with good reason. It has already lived up to (and exceeded) its reputation as a tech hub with a high quality of life and a low cost of living. One of the purposes of this blog will be to catalogue the many memories Kate and I make here, since my brain is already buckling under the weight of processing 5 different computer languages + Portuguese. After going through this coding journey 5 years ago, Kate is now running her own successful web development business and is a daily source of inspiration.

This blog might not look like much (yet), but I am already very proud of it. Unlike the prebuilt Wordpress blogs that I've used in the past, there was far more programming involved in bringing Postal Codes and my adjoining portfolio website to life. I chose this blog platform (Jekyll) due to its fast load times and security. I customized the CSS design, configured a CMS system that I feel comfortable with, and set up RSS feeds so that you, the esteemed blog visitor, can subscribe to post notifications (if I'm so lucky).

With that said, I'll keep this first chapter short and sweet. After all, coding is just half the battle and now the blog needs content. I promise the next few posts won't be so meta, but for now, I think it's time for a "Good night, world" from this tired coder.
