>Maybe I'm spoiled by the instant gratification of today's Netflix-esque, full-season releases, but I couldn't stand the thought of releasing this blog bare and with only one new episode. So here's some syndicated oldie but goodies from my asian blog [Sideways Stories From Wayguk School](https://sidewaysstories.wordpress.com/)...

There’s a place not far from my house that’s arguably the soul of Korea. Hiding behind the wall of apartment buildings, and beneath the roaring interstate to Seoul, lies a small, damp tunnel. This tunnel leads away from all the factories, schools, stores, and traffic, to a much quieter and simpler place.

A cluster of mountains looms over the tunnel’s exit, seemingly transporting me from the city to the wild in a matter of seconds. I have to blink a few times before I leave the shadows, and then I start hiking up the orange path that leads into the hills. After only a few steps the original trail splinters into a hundred hidden foot paths that wind through this enclosed forest.

Some paths lead to shady pagodas for the ever-hiking Koreans. Others lead to terraces of peaceful tombs that overlook the city. The rest lead to gardens built by a mysterious club of gardeners, who come from all over Sintanjin to make use of this rich oasis.

I call this phenomenon guerrilla gardening, and I’m pretty sure it happens anywhere enough dirt can be scraped together. The older Koreans borrow this land to grow their beloved ingredients. Peppers, beansprouts, cabbage and herbs are cultivated in neat little lines. Then, tanned hands groom them until they are ripe enough for peddling on bus stops, truck beds, and the monthly Sintanjin market. Even in the heart of the city it’s normal to see two department stores towering over a patch of dust that has been claimed by these industrious green thumbs.

To me it seems like this practice would end in some sort of legal action in the possessive United States. I guess in that respect, this old world horticulture is a refreshing concept.

As I walk down the mountain trail, the rows of crops pop out of the woods like clues from a lost civilization. Boundaries are made with whatever resources they can haul. Most times sticks and stones, but sometimes recycled banners and advertisements from the city. It’s puzzling to see nature being tamed with such commercial flair. Vegetables literally sprout out of colorful Korean characters that lay claim to the city’s most succulent pork ribs. Seems like an anachronism.

Usually I associate gardening with hobbyists or old people, but in my little paradise everyone seems to do it. Families tend to their garden on a Sunday evening while the shade of twilight keeps it cool. Grandfather’s chew ginseng as they spread out a fresh layer of sour-smelling manure. A mother thumbs seeds into the ground as her wide-eyed baby sucks his own thumb from the sling on her back.

This is the Korea I wanted to see. Natural, simplistic, and beautiful. These gardens are preserving Korea’s earliest roots, and seeing the people look after them offers an intimate glimpse into their past. Though I’m mostly just a kid from the suburbs, I can relate to this in my own small way. Farming’s in my blood from one side of the family to the other, so I feel magnetism toward these pungent rows of earth.

Yet this valley was hidden to me when we first got to the city. I never imagined such a place could even exist among the jumble of paper and tire factories I cringe to call home. But then one day I stumbled upon it, in the same way I stumble upon everything in Korea: by making lots of mistakes.

I took the wrong bus home one fall afternoon and impulsively abandoned ship when I realized I was heading for an unknown district of the Daejeon grid. It wasn’t a bad call either, because it didn’t look like I had gotten too far off track. Only a foothill separated my “dong” (neighborhood) from the one I was currently standing in, so I figured the best thing I could do was just to buy a bottle of water and set off for this hill.

The next two hours or so reminded me of that manufactured saying you see on car mirrors: “Objects in mirror are closer than they appear.” Only this time the perspective was directly inverted. As I stumbled through valleys of brush wearing a dress shirt and slacks, I realized that my distorted lens of Korea was making objects seem close that were regrettably far away.

Before long, my impromptu hike revealed that this solitary foothill was actually a collection of hills and valleys surrounded by an 8 lane highway. Getting into the sanctuary had been relatively easy. Getting out looked decidedly harder.

After a while I found a series of hiking trails that led to exercise equipment and a route down one of the ridges. I plopped down on a rowing machine and peeled off my Oxford shirt with a bewildered sigh. At this point I think I daydreamed about the length of time it would take for Kate to send a rescue team. However I concluded that this was a doomed proposition from the start, since our vocabulary was pretty much limited to “hello, America, thank you, and delicious,” back then. Sadly not much has changed.

Thankfully I didn’t feel stressed, or mad, or even lost in this predicament. Compared to the neighboring industrial gloom, this place was starting to feel like the paradisaical valley of Shangri-la. I donned a half-zipped fleece on my now bare skin, stuffed my drenched Oxford into my backpack, and continued plodding left at each fork down the mountain, reassuring myself with deep breaths of fresh air and the steady mantra, “I’ll get home eventually.”

Before long, I started spotting mounds at many of the vantage points overlooking the city. These were in fact Korean graves, that looked something like ancient burial mounds. At each site there was typically one grassy dome measuring six feet in diameter, surrounded by an arc that had been dug into the hillside. From above, the whole configuration started to resemble the shape of a calla lily, and I admit it was pleasing to look at.

The more recent tombs had stately black pillars with winged tops and Hangul characters, presumably identifying the people who belonged to these final resting places. Then, in the center of the valley there were older tombs that were sinking back into the hillside. Wildflowers and weeds covered these mounds in a colorful fur that was starting to conceal the man-made alterations made so many years ago. If this doesn’t paint a serene picture, I assure you that it was. I promised to come here again after blazing a reliable trail back.

Before I knew it, I was walking alongside highway traffic as it slowly pushed home. In another stroke of luck the path I chose changed to concrete and started descending into a tunnel that went under all 8 lanes of the road. I popped out on the other side and my suspicions were confirmed. I had successfully trekked my way home.

It was almost dark and I was a grubby, sweaty mess, but I was exhilarated by what I’d found. Here was a piece of Korea that had barely escaped the 21st century, and it was practically in my backyard. Long live Shangri-la!
