excerpt: Welcome to the jungle. Squirrels don’t climb the trees here, snakes do. Elephants take longer baths in a day than I’ve taken all week, and monkeys are just another variety of road kill. Temperatures hover around a steamy 80 degrees, and every morning the geckos wake me up before the indignant roosters even get a chance. Bacteria is rampant, everything is wet, and mosquitoes have claimed this corner of the world as their evil headquarters. Still, I can’t help but fall in love.

>Maybe I'm spoiled by the instant gratification of today's Netflix-esque, full-season releases, but I couldn't stand the thought of releasing this blog bare and with only one new episode. So here's some syndicated oldie but goodies from my asian blog [Sideways Stories From Wayguk School](https://sidewaysstories.wordpress.com/)...



Welcome to the jungle. Squirrels don’t climb the trees here, snakes do. Elephants take longer baths in a day than I’ve taken all week, and monkeys are just another variety of road kill. Temperatures hover around a steamy 80 degrees, and every morning the geckos wake me up before the indignant roosters even get a chance. Bacteria is rampant, everything is wet, and mosquitoes have claimed this corner of the world as their evil headquarters. Still, I can’t help but fall in love. This is the closest I’ve ever been to the fabled places I dream about.  A real life inspiration for treasure island, skull island, and Jurassic Park to name a few.

The place I’m talking about is Koh Chang, Thailand’s second largest island and one of its gorgeous national parks. It takes its name from its resemblance to an elephant’s head (it literally translates as Elephant Island). Thais are particularly fond of this animal, and Koh Chang serves as some great living proof. Its name, its elephant sanctuaries, and the Chang beer served at all its watering holes, definitely give this place the look and feel of a pachyderm paradise.

During our stay, I was lucky enough to check off a number of things from my bucket list. I drove a motorcycle, I plunged into a waterfall pool, and I petted a baby elephant. In fact, I swam and rode with the elephants like a true Mahout, if you’ll look past the fact that I had no clue how to steer the beasts.

For three nights I also experienced one of the worst side-effects of traveling in a foreign land: falling ill to foreign bacteria. I don’t know how, but as soon as the sun started to sink below the horizon, my transformation began. Good night, Mr. Busby, Good Evening, Mr. Hyde. When the jungle started to come alive, so did my fever. It’s a helpless feeling when all you can do is shiver and moan at all the encroaching creepy crawlies (hallucinated and real). I’d like to thank mosquito canopies, modern medicine, and my girlfriend for getting me through those long nights.

But back to the daytime, when everything resumed its friendly, exhilarating course. The island’s geography is beautiful, but it’s also a little bit imposing.  Mountains, cliffs, and jungle cover most of the terrain, making  the interior only penetrable by foot or elephant. That’s where the wild things really are.

One road goes from the Elephant’s neck on the west coast to the elephant’s trunk in the east, making a giant horseshoe that never really connects. You can motorbike from one side of the island to the other safely in a little under 2 hours,  something I knew I had to accomplish during our stay. With a few tips from our bungalow owner, my camera, and a thick coat of sunscreen, I set out on my first real adventure in years.

Here are a few of the secrets I found along the way:

<br>

### 1. Tropical Ghost Town:

Just south of Lonely Beach is an old dilapidated resort that has adventure written all over it. Rumor has it that the “Grand” Lagoona Resort was abandoned in the early 2000’s after a billionaire with questionable ties was accused of money laundering and botched building codes.

This was a great starting place for a number of reasons. The lack of traffic and hairpin turns gave me a feel for my new set of wheels. I was allowed access to a gorgeous, deserted beach with shady hammocks and a view. And finally, the resort grounds just seemed to exude a hushed air that whispered of maritime murder mysteries.

The ride to the lagoon was bliss. I eased the bike through patches of cool jungle shade, alternately gaining and losing speed as I crested the looming hills. At 70 km/h the scents of citrus, sunscreen, dank soil, and ocean whipped into my nose like pungent ribbons, only to be yanked out again by the wind.

After several stretches of  shacks with beat up antennas and yards choked by vegetation, I pulled up to the resort gates. It was obvious that this was one of the more remote corners of the island from the way the earth was slowly reclaiming the road. After coughing up a measly 50 baht ($1.50), I eased my bike into the abandoned resort.

The road to the clubhouse was lined with drooping palm trees and the weathered statues of posing elephants.  At first glance it simply felt like a resort in its off season, but the closer I looked the more I started to notice the age and decay hanging over it all.

Before I got far, I immediately spotted a 4 or 5 story boat that was moored in a small pond. I found out that the builders had removed part of the beach to drive the boat in and then filled the sand back in to  maroon the vessel. After securing it, they turned “The Galaxy” into a boat hotel. Pretty  gimmicky, but I might have slept there in its hay-day. Nowadays I doubt I have the courage to spend one night aboard.  It’s a bona fide ghost ship.

I stepped off the gangplank and started treading softly across the baby-blue, carpeted lobby. It was so quiet that I felt safer creeping around like a ninja, my only weapon the flash on my camera. I took the stairs to the second floor, knowing that I didn’t trust the dusty, old elevator for a second. This floor was the first row of hotel rooms. A long hallway, constructed of dark wood and blood-red carpet, was illuminated solely by the natural light from the ship’s deck at the very end. The hotel rooms were largely intact, some still with beds. A cleaning cart was parked in front of one of the rooms, making it seem like the maid had gone to use the restroom. For 30 minutes or so I was convinced that there were some sort of staff aboard the ship with me, slowly sorting through the remnants of a decade of use.

As I moved up floor by floor, I became more and more certain that the ship was deserted. The only thing that puzzled me was how much stuff they’d left behind. Dishes were in the kitchen, the restaurant’s tables were ready to be eaten off of, and mattresses were piled neatly in the storage rooms. Additionally, all the staff rooms were unlocked, leaving the ship open to any vagabond that fancied free cutlery and bed linens. It looked like this ship was left in a hurry.

By this time I was in full on Hardy-boy mode. I explored the highest floor of the ship, which offered a beautiful view of the valley the resort nestled in. In one formidably dark staff room, I found a rung ladder that led up to the ship’s roof and some of its controls. Here I had a 360 view of the valley, since this spot lacked the obtrusive guard rails of the floor below. I sat for a while in the ocean breeze and watched as the mist rolled in over the mountains.

I worked my way back down to the lobby, but before I left I decided to check out the basement. Up until this point I had been fairly confident poking around. The basement was another story. Pitch black tunnels snaked away from a dimly lit pub. Cobwebs and the sound of running water gave me the creeps and suddenly that was enough sight seeing for me. I couldn’t help but think that every horror story or traveler’s trap waited down one of those tunnels. I also didn’t want to be the stupid tourist who fell through the ship’s floor and drowned. I contented myself with sitting at the ghost bar for a few minutes, and then headed outside for some much needed sunshine. A few laps in the lagoon’s turquoise water cured me up just fine.

Later, I learned a final secret. If I had kayaked around the jut of the resort’s western mountains, I would have discovered a small, secluded beach. I’ve decided to go back someday and dub this beach the “Ghost cove.”

### 2. Spiritual Fusion:

Driving one hour in the other direction lands you right near the island’s main ferry. The drive there is much more harrowing due to the sharp 90 degree turns, but it’s worth the extra time and stress. If you are brave enough to sneak a peak, the coastline is jaw-dropping. From up there our small Lonely Beach looked like a distant civilization, and I felt like its proud conquistador. When I looked past the villa roofs and the commercial signs, it was easy to imagine the land’s most primal era.

Right before you reach the ferry dock, the curves of an ornate temple peep out from the top of a steep driveway. This excursion began as a perfunctory pit stop; riding a bike for that long will make you sore! But it ended as a moment of intensive reflection for me. The bold greens and reds of the temple’s eaves inspired flashbacks to the Buddhist temples I saw in China. Apparently this temple was influenced by both Thai and Chinese architecture, so I guess my mind wasn’t playing tricks on me.

After inhaling the wispy incense and padding barefoot on the temple’s lawn, I decided to take a small path into the forest. Here I found the skeleton of a collapsed house on the cliff”s edge. I rested on the concrete foundation for a while and let my thoughts float out over the green water like kites. It was only when I felt the world tugging them too far, that I decided to reel them all back in.

I consulted the Plexiglas map at the base of the temple, adjusted my mirrors, and I was on my way.

### 3. Monkeys and Cliff Divers

Pass the island’s two ferries on its northern point, and you hit Koh Chang’s eastern coast. Imagine a completely different vibe, a slower way of life, and a change in physical terrain. The east coast doesn’t have the pretty, sandy beaches that summon boat-loads of tourists. It has short muddy beaches with small lapping waves, reminding me more of the quiet edge of a lake than a horizon-less ocean.

I reached the height of serenity driving here. The cars were few, and the roads were smooth. Gentle hills with wide curves let me lean and coast to their conclusion. Flat stretches were made for throttling and hearing the engine whine. At these speeds the air became a churning cushion, buffeting my hair and cheeks to a cosmic, cyclical beat. Purple flowers exploded into view like aromatic fireworks. Fruit stands of paradise streaked by in psychedelic trails. Dogs turned to face the howling banshee on their tail. Everything was blurring. My eyes, my silhouette, the very life around me. It was as if I’d zoomed into a Dali painting and time itself was melting.

Speeding down the coast made the fuel drop quickly, so I pulled over at one of the many Mom and Pop stores that lined the way. They sold a bit of everything in their shady front yards, from bottles of coke to bottles of gasoline. Refilling was a fun experience. They store the gas in old beer bottles and stack them on card tables with hand-painted signs. From the road it looks like a fresh lemonade stand, but instead of serving you cold beverages they’re essentially handing you Molotov cocktails. Two of these bottles filled my little bike up easily. I said goodbye to the friendly Thai lady, who was kind enough to cheer me on as I jerked my way out of her bumpy dirt, driveway.

Of the few planned excursions I had for this trip, one was to find a suitable waterfall for us to visit. Fortunately, a perfect fit was waiting just around the corner. I hopped off my bike right as the ranger was closing up, but she waved me in smiling since dusk was fast approaching. I ran up the trail and peered at the cliff. The Than Mayom waterfall wasn’t the most impressive I’d seen, but it did look like it had plenty of fun swimming holes. After resting a few minutes by one of the pools, I jogged back to the bike to race the darkness home.

The ranger’s family was out on the porch peeling vegetables for dinner as I left. This ordinary scene became considerably more exotic when I saw a baby monkey chained to the fence by her tail. They introduced me to their pet, Natalie, who had learned to swing from the chain like a furry wrecking ball, and was now repeatedly flinging herself off the fence for added momentum. I stuck around long enough to watch the ranger feed Natalie some fruit. And then she did it with her mouth. Oh no she didn’t, I thought to myself. This lady had obviously never seen 28 Days Later or Contagion. Seriously though, most of the Macaque monkeys carry hepatitis B, so you wouldn’t catch me kissing one for all the baht in Thailand.

The next day Kate and I saddled up and made our way back to the grotto. Riding the bike with two people is a bit more challenging, especially when it comes to sharp turns and heavy traffic. Also, the extra weight on those roller coaster hills had me praying that the brakes would hold.  Regardless, we made it to the east coast without a hitch and passed the island’s very modest hospital and fire station. I doubt many people bother calling this fire station for help. By the time the truck got its way around to the west coast, the flames and the shack would be long gone.

At the waterfall, we bought our tickets and started up the shady river bed. Lizards skittered out of the way as we hopped from one boulder to the next, making a zigzagging path toward the sound of falling water. We rounded the river bend, and were greeted by the large rock face that propelled the falls. It had two pools, one that we could wade in straightaway and another, slightly more hidden pool that required some hiking to get to. After posing for some preliminary pictures, we did precisely that.

We climbed over the ridge and crawled to the edge of the second pool. It was so deep that the water appeared black, a yawning mouth covered by a sheet of rippling obsidian. Crayfish scuttled around the sunlit lip, eyeing my pale feet hungrily. Minnows actually indulged, nibbling at my toes in darting shadows, a free pedicure compliments of mother nature.

Swimming in the hole filled me with a nervous energy. God only knew how far down it went and what might call this place home. Childhood fears of touching an unknown floor welled up from somewhere deep down. Still the water felt so cool and refreshing, I couldn’t resist its sweet invitation.

While drying off on the warm rocks, I noticed a knotted rope that had been hammered into the cliff side. Upon closer inspection it looked like it led to a small ridge that ran 20 feet above the pool’s circumference. After yanking the rope a few times and wiping my wet feet on some dry rock, I began hoisting myself up the rock face. With Kate cheering me on, I reached the ridge and walked in a crouch to the far side.

It was pretty obvious that I was going to have to dive into the pool to get down, but I wanted to see what was above the falls first. A long slab of stone stretched out behind the water’s edge to form a channel between the mountains. I ran across the hot stone with quick feet and a light heart. The sun tickled my back, and I suddenly felt more than just an English teacher on vacation. I was a child of the wild. I was Mowgli as he ran through the jungle, singing about life’s bare necessities. I could almost feel the panther following me languidly through the trees.

I ran until I hit another pool and a cliff that twisted right. An aerial view would probably reveal the river snaking back and forth in a series of drops and climbs. As much as I wanted to continue climbing this giant, aquatic stairway, I ran back to tell Kate what exactly I’d stumbled upon.

I came to the edge of our black oasis and stared down at Kate sunning below. A decision had to be made. To jump or not to jump. I spent several minutes calculating the risk, and came to the conclusion that climbing down would be more dangerous than taking the plunge. Hopefully all the years of pounding water had done its job and drilled this hole deep enough.  I took one last breath and leaped. A howl broke loose as I fell into the void.

I resurfaced with the silliest grin on my face. “Kate, you’ve got to try this.” For another hour or so we took turns jumping and taking action photos of each other.

This was it, folks. I had reached Thai nirvana. For as long as I live, I will always remember what it was like to leap off of a waterfall.

I can’t describe how hard it was to leave later that afternoon.  As we made our way back down the rocks, we noticed a dirty old sign that said No Cliff Climbing. Sometimes its nice being blissfully unaware.

### 4. Sittin’ on the dock of the sea

Swimming made me hungry. It always does. So we decided to search the nearby fishing village, Dan Mai, for some fresh seafood. This is probably the most populated area on the east coast, and to the foreign eye it appears mostly as a jumbled collection of bungalows, docks, and gardens. Many children mill about, riding bikes to and fro while their fathers fish, giving the place a warm and cheerful feel. I’d gotten lost there the day before while looking for a mangrove stand, and all I’d gotten from the villagers were smiles and unassuming looks.

Now we were on a mission for grub. We followed several signs for “Dan Mai’s best seafood” through the narrow streets and found a bright red restaurant on the water. The waitress led us down the dock to a thatched hut that was empty and out of the sun. We were the only customers at this sleepy establishment, and it felt like we had the world to ourselves.

The menu was big, but we narrowed it down to several tasty choices. I had 6 prawns coated in a garlic, nut-encrusted glaze, that were the perfect levels of sweet and salty. Kate had the famous shrimp soup, tom yum goong, which is a deliciously thin and refreshing summer soup. Somehow it is the saltiest soup I have ever tasted, but it is also sweet from the coconut and citrus juice they use.  Sharing Thai food while listening to the lapping waves was the most therapeutic ending to an already fantastic day.

Riding home was chilly in the shadow of the eastern mountains. I couldn’t believe that my first motorcycle adventure was coming to a close, but there was one final surprise in store.

I cruised at a steady speed so that we might catch the sun before its final bow. We wound our way up and around the mountains toward home and turned into a resort at Kai Bai as the sun was just starting to set. Though clouds were threatening to ruin the show, we were offered something better. In the shallows, two Thais were bathing a pair of baby elephants in the light blue water. I sat transfixed as the elephants played together. Had we slipped into a dream? I knew we were witnessing something special.

One Mahout started practicing commands with his wrinkly friend. It looked like the young Thai was attempting to stand on the elephant’s back.  At the scene’s climax the young Thai climbed gracefully on top the elephant’s back as it reared up onto its hind legs. The pair of man and beast painted a majestic silhouette against the  sun streaked sky.

An hour later I laid in a hammock and relived every little detail of the trip in my mind. Riding off the map had been life changing, but it was hard to say why. Maybe it was just the beauty of paradise that struck me, but I felt that it was something else. In a more profound way, this trip helped me come to terms with the person I’ll be no matter which road I take.
