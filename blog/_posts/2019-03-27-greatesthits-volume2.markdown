excerpt: Warm weather returned this week and to a large degree so did my sanity. It’s easy to forget how much winter affects my mood until the next pleasant breeze blows through. Though this winter was exceedingly cold and frustrating, none of the bad memories seem that heavy anymore. Somehow the sun has a way of sneaking into my darkroom and wiping clean the negatives.

>Maybe I'm spoiled by the instant gratification of today's Netflix-esque, full-season releases, but I couldn't stand the thought of releasing this blog bare and with only one new episode. So here's some syndicated oldie but goodies from my asian blog [Sideways Stories From Wayguk School](https://sidewaysstories.wordpress.com/)...

Warm weather returned this week and to a large degree so did my sanity. It’s easy to forget how much winter affects my mood until the next pleasant breeze blows through. Though this winter was exceedingly cold and frustrating, none of the bad memories seem that heavy anymore. Somehow the sun has a way of sneaking into my darkroom and wiping clean the negatives.

I have to admit, being a teacher has its perks. Take now for instance, when the sounds of playing children float through my open window. There is something so pure and innocent to that sound. Suddenly all my grievances about the long work week seem pointless and shallow.

A soccer ball just missed the window and the opportunity to destroy the cubicle next to mine.  Look at me. I can’t stop grinning. Maybe I’m a prime example of someone who suffers from that seasonal affective disorder, S.A.D., or whatever they call it. Which reminds me, I heard that during the glum winters of Scandinavia, alcohol is scarce simply because it adds to everyone’s depression. How sad is that.

Meanwhile the sun is weaving magic in the mountains of Korea. Exotic flowers that I’ve never seen before are popping up before my eyes, and the smells are intoxicating. It’s nice to fill my nose with something other than bus exhaust every now and then.

The most popular flowers are the cherry blossoms by far. Cherry festivals are sprouting up left and right, so the cool thing to do right now is to grab a loved one or some friends and walk down one of the tree-lined avenues.

It’s funny, because the cherry tree is Japanese in origin. If you know anything about Korean or Japanese history, the two cultures don’t exactly see eye to eye. But while Koreans might be bitter about a lot of things the Japanese have done, they still adore the cherry tree.

And with good reason. This tree has an otherworldly beauty that anyone can appreciate. Like my co-teacher said, “A beautiful thing, is a beautiful thing.” I guess that explains why we have our own large collection of cherry trees in Washington, D.C.

I took the long route home from school yesterday to see what all the fuss was about. Coincidentally, Korea’s largest cigarette factory is right down the road from my school, and perhaps what’s more ironic, they have one of the best cherry blossom displays in Daejeon.

I followed a couple through the back gate, and stared at the guard with a look that said, “I hope I’m doing this right.” He just smiled and said hello, meaning I was free to do as I pleased as long as I didn’t break in and steal the recipe to their secret tobacco blend.

For once on this trip I had my camera prepped and ready to go, so I enjoyed the freedom of strolling and snapping away. Happy people were abound and the feeling was infectious. Together we felt like hungry bees harvesting on what happiness the flowers could share.

After a while, I stumbled across the most stunning avenue of them all. This sandy road was hemmed in by two lines of heavily laden trees, giving it the look of an orchard after a fresh snow. And when the breeze picked up, the individual petals lifted from the branches and flew against my face like snowflakes, only not so cold and wet. Suffice to say, the moment was surreal.

The whole scene was indicatively Asian, and in this instance the reality of  being across the world sunk in once again. With my time here coming to a close, I’m trying to immerse myself in as much Asia as possible.
